# turtle_navigation
Enables parallel instances of Navigation2 for TurtleBot3's, inspired by [carter_navigation](https://docs.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/latest/ros2_tutorials/tutorial_ros2_multi_navigation.html) from NVIDIA. Made to work with [multi-agent SLAM](https://github.com/SteveMacenski/slam_toolbox/pull/592).
